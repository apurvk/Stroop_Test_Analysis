# Stroop_Test_Analysis
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. 


If you just download up the file Stroop_Test.html, I believe that would act as a better Readme file.

Check out StroopTest.pdf to check out my analysis. Feel free to download and check it out for yourself.

Enjoy and thanks for checking out my profile.
